## Introduction
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) can persist in a latent state in humans for many years before causing disease. Latency has been found to be linked to hypoxia (lack  of oxygen) in the host. We suspect that genes that are activated in  hypoxia are regulated by a common transcription factor. We have access to the upstream sequences of MTB genes upregulated in hypoxia, and our objective is to identify the 20-bp motif representing the binding site for the transcription factor that regulates these genes.

## Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to investigate the effects of climate change on biodiversity in a specific region. We will analyze historical climate data and biodiversity indicators to assess trends and identify potential correlations.

## Scope
This project will focus on a selected geographical area known for its rich biodiversity. We will examine changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and other climatic factors over the past few decades. Additionally, we will assess the impact of these changes on species abundance, distribution, and habitat suitability.

## Problem Statement
Climate change poses a significant threat to biodiversity, leading to shifts in ecosystems, loss of habitat, and decline in species populations. By studying the relationship between climate variables and biodiversity indicators, we aim to gain insights into the drivers of ecological change and inform conservation efforts.

## Methodology
1. Data collection: Gather historical climate data from reliable sources such as meteorological stations and satellite observations. Obtain biodiversity data from field surveys, research databases, and species distribution models.
2. Analysis: 
3. Modeling: Develop predictive models to project future climate scenarios and their impact on biodiversity. Assess the vulnerability of species and ecosystems to climate change.
4. Interpretation: Interpret the findings in the context of existing scientific literature and theoretical frameworks. Discuss implications for conservation policy and management strategies.

## Data Collection
- Climate data: Monthly temperature, precipitation, humidity, and other climatic variables.
- Biodiversity data: Species richness, abundance, distribution maps, habitat characteristics.

## Analysis
1. Motif Locations: On analysis of upsteam250.txt using MEME with a motif width of 20 we receive the following results

## Conclusion
This project aims to contribute to our understanding of the complex interactions between climate change and biodiversity. By analyzing historical data and projecting future scenarios, we hope to inform evidence-based decision-making and promote conservation efforts in the face of environmental change.
