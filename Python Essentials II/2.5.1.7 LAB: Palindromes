Estimated time
15-30 minutes

Level of difficulty
Easy

Objectives
improving the student's skills in operating with strings;
encouraging the student to look for non-obvious solutions.
Scenario
Do you know what a palindrome is?

It's a word which look the same when read forward and backward. For example, "kayak" is a palindrome, while "loyal" is not.

Your task is to write a program which:

asks the user for some text;
checks whether the entered text is a palindrome, and prints result.
Note:

assume that an empty string isn't a palindrome;
treat upper- and lower-case letters as equal;
spaces are not taken into account during the check - treat them as non-existent;
there are more than a few correct solutions - try to find more than one.
Test your code using the data we've provided.

Test data
Sample input:

Ten animals I slam in a net

Sample output:

It's a palindrome


Sample input:

Eleven animals I slam in a net

Sample output:

It's not a palindrome

    # convert all the alphabets to lower
    text = text.lower()

    for i in range(len(text)):
        
        # another pointer to check from the end
        j = len(text) - i - 1
        
        # compare both pointers
        if text[i] == text[j]:
            j -= 1
        else:
            print("It's not a palindrome")
            return False
            
    print("It's a palindrome")
    return True
    
    
text = input("Enter a word or sentence: ")

# Output:
    
# Enter a word or sentence: Ten animals I slam in a net
# It's a palindrome
# Enter a word or sentence: Eleven animals I slam in a net
# It's not a palindrome
