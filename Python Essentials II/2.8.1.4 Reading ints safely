Objectives
improving the student's skills in defining functions;
using exceptions in order to provide a safe input environment.
Scenario
Your task is to write a function able to input integer values and to check if they are within a specified range.

The function should:

accept three arguments: a prompt, a low acceptable limit, and a high acceptable limit;
if the user enters a string that is not an integer value, the function should emit the message Error: wrong input, and ask the user to input the value again;
if the user enters a number which falls outside the specified range, the function should emit the message Error: the value is not within permitted range (min..max) and ask the user to input the value again;
if the input value is valid, return it as a result.
Test data
Test your code carefully.

This is how the function should react to the user's input:

Enter a number from -10 to 10: 100
Error: the value is not within permitted range (-10..10)
Enter a number from -10 to 10: asd
Error: wrong input
Enter number from -10 to 10: 1
The number is: 1

def read_int(prompt, min, max):
       
    # flag is set to keep the loop running
    valid = False
    
    # loop will keep asking as long as the flag is false
    while valid == False:
        
        try:
            
            # ask the input from the user
            value = input(prompt)
            
            # check if the input value is a digit
            if value.isdigit() == False:
                raise ValueError
            
            # if it is a digit check if it is in the range 
            if  int(value) >= min and int(value) <= max:
                valid = True
            else:
                raise Exception
            
        # exception raised for non numeric input   
        except ValueError:
            print("wrong input")
        
        # for all other issues we raise default exception
        except:
            print("The value is not within permitted range (-10..10)")
     
    return int(value)   
    
        
v = read_int("Enter a number from -10 to 10: ", -10, 10)

print("The number is:", v)


# Output:
    
# Enter a number from -10 to 10: 100
# The value is not within permitted range (-10..10)
# Enter a number from -10 to 10: asd
# wrong input
# Enter a number from -10 to 10: 1
# The number is: 1
